There are two main ways that employment agreements deal with these situations.\nFirst, an employment agreement might say that you only get the usual period of notice, without compensation, if there’s a technical redundancy. Your agreement might say that if the business is sold and you decline employment on the same (or substantially similar) terms with the new employer you won’t get redundancy compensation.

It names the parties and who or what work the agreement will cover (coverage clause). This is a legal requirement before bargaining can happen. It can be signed by the union or employer, or their agent.\nThe coverage clause comes from the party who starts the bargaining. This describes the work and/or employees they want to cover. It’s negotiable in the bargaining, for instance, a union may want to cover managers but an employer may oppose it. A secret ballot of union members or employers must be held if more than one employer or union is a party in the notice.

It’s important the bond is of reasonable length, and the other features are in proportion to the commitment made by you.\nIt could be lawful for your employer to recover costs for airfares if you’re an overseas worker coming to New Zealand (on the basis that this cost wouldn’t ordinarily be borne by your employer), and for buying tools which you would own (as this would provide you with a benefit, and tradespeople usually own their own tools).\nIf an employer is considering recovering costs from an employee or bonding, careful consideration should be given to whether the employee will benefit from the arrangement, over and above the benefit the employee has from being employed. If not, and particularly if the cost is normally covered by the employer or has been in the past, cost recovery or a bond may breach the Wages Protection Act.    \nFor example, sometimes your employer may only offer you a job if you agree to pay back employment-related costs like trade testing with deductions from your wages. There’s no benefit to you in meeting these costs, as essentially the only benefit is being offered the job. The courts have ruled that the act of paying to acquire a job could fall under the category of a premium."},"linkedTopics":{"iv":["8d36d249-c872-49a9-a46a-6f5352598c01","afeb18f6-636c-4e69-9293-c99bf61a7786"]},"source":{"iv":"https://www.employers.co.nz/training-agreements-june-2014-newsletter-newsitem.aspx; https://employmentcourt.govt.nz/assets/Documents/Decisions/2016-NZEmpC-167-Labour-Inspector-v-Tech-5-Recruitment-Ltd-jud-161216.pdf"},"Tags":{"iv":[]},"category":{"iv":[]},"intentKey":{"iv":"a719b2f7-6221-41c6-8332-8abc440ae33a"},"exampleQuestions":{"iv":[{"question":"Do I have to reimburse my employer for training if i leave my job?"}]}},"created":"2020-06-23T22:26:04Z","lastModified":"2020-06-26T00:57:11Z","status":"Published","statusColor":"#4bb958","schemaName":"topic","schemaDisplayName":"topic","version":2,"_links":{"self":{"href":"/api/content/workbot/topic/58864e31-4410-40b4-baa2-1cc77d958e27","method":"GET"},"previous":{"href":"/api/content/workbot/topic/58864e31-4410-40b4-baa2-1cc77d958e27/1","method":"GET"}}},{"id":"ca555922-7f57-49f6-811b-684b7e7f3872","createdBy":"client:workbot:cli","lastModifiedBy":"subject:5ec494b7591f3d00019426fe","data":{"name":{"iv":"Paying for training"},"buttonLabel":{"iv":"Paying for training"},"answer":{"iv":"Whether or not you get paid for the cost of training (the course fees and your time to be there) depends.
