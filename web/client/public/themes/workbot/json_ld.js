        "text": "A union representative or &quot;organiser&quot; may enter a workplace to represent members by participating in bargaining, carrying out recruitment, discussing matters with members and providing information about the union to employees. They can also come in to support compliance with employment law, collective agreements and dealing with matters concerning the health and safety of members, and deal with things about a proposed or current individual employment agreement or its terms and conditions.\n[more]\nAnother reason a union representative can enter a workplace is to help a non-union employee with matters relating to health and safety if that employee has asked them for help. This reflects the importance of union representatives in giving advice and support about health and safety in the workplace, both to members and non-members.\nA union rep can only talk to an employee for a reasonable length of time and their boss can’t deduct pay for the time they were talking. A discussion with a rep is not a union meeting.\nA union rep should access the workplace in a reasonable way during the usual hours of work. They have to tell the employer why they’re there and show ID, and comply with health and safety. If they can’t find the employer or representative, they have leave in writing their name, union, date and time of entry and why they entered.\nA union rep can be refused entry for limited grounds, for example it might affect the security or defence of New Zealand or the investigation or detection of crimes, or if an employer has a certificate of exemption on religious grounds. \n[https://www.employment.govt.nz/starting-employment/unions-and-bargaining/unions/]"

A ‘notice of initiation of bargaining’ is a letter signed by the union or the employer saying they want to bargain for a collective agreement. It names the parties and who or what work the agreement will cover (coverage clause). This is a legal requirement before bargaining can happen. It can be signed by the union or employer, or their agent.\nThe coverage clause comes from the party who starts the bargaining. This describes the work and/or employees they want to cover. It’s negotiable in the bargaining, for instance, a union may want to cover managers but an employer may oppose it. A secret ballot of union members or employers must be held if more than one employer or union is a party in the notice.

If you want to even up the balance, you can get legal advice on the contract you are being asked to sign from:\n• The New Zealand Prostitutes Collective (NZPC)\n• a Community Law Centre\n• A lawyer. \nIt’s common for brothel operators to include in contracts a system of fines for things like turning up late or wearing the wrong clothes. If these fines are unreasonable and more like a punishment than about the true cost to the business of what you’re doing, then your boss might not be able to get them enforced if you took your boss to court. Someone from the NZPC can help you negotiate a better contract.\n[Source:https://communitylaw.org.nz/community-law-manual/chapter-19-starting-and-leaving-a-job/sex-workers-your-rights/your-rights-when-doing-sex-work/]\n[FU: Want to know more about how some &#x27;contractors&#x27; are actually employees?: Sex work - sex worker rights - employee]"

If you’re not a union member, you can join and then you’ll be covered by the collective agreement. If there’s no collective agreement, or if you’re not a union member, you’ll have an individual employment agreement negotiated between you and your employer. \nWhen your boss offers you an individual agreement, they have to tell you there’s a collective agreement for your work, that you can join the union, and how to contact the union. If there’s more than one collective agreement, the one that binds more employees is the one your boss has to tell you about. They also have to tell you that if you join the union, the collective agreement will bind you, give you a copy of the collective agreement, and if you agree, tell the union that you’re on an individual agreement.\nIf you join the union at any time, you automatically join the collective agreement (as long as it covers your work). If you have a minimum wage exemption permit, you’ll be paid the rate in the permit as long as the union agrees.\n[Source: Employment Relations Act 2000, ss 56(1), 62;\nhttps://www.employment.govt.nz/starting-employment/employment-agreements/offering-employment-agreements/]"
